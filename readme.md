# Cole(re)mak For (Neo)Vim
Coleremak is a simple approach to the problem of using Vim with the 
[colemak][1] keyboard layout. It attempts to simply remap every modified
key to its physical equivalent on <kbd>QWERTY</kbd>, with the exception of <kbd>O</kbd> being 
remaped to <kbd>P</kbd> (Because, on colemak <kbd>;</kbd> replaces <kbd>P</kbd>).
