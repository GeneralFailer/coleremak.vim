# Cole(re)mak For (Neo)Vim
Coleremak is a simple approach to the problem of using Vim with the 
[colemak][1] keyboard layout. It attempts to simply remap every modified
key to its physical equivalent on QWERTY, with the exception of 'o' being 
remaped to 'p' (Because the colon key on colemak replaces 'p').
